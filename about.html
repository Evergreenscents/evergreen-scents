      <h1>About Our Family Business</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Evergreen Scents</strong> is a small, family-run business nestled deep within the beautiful
        <strong>Forest of Dean</strong>. What began as a creative hobby quickly grew into a passion — and that passion
        became a mission to share the beauty of nature through fragrance and light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every candle and wax melt we produce is <strong>hand-poured and made to order</strong>. We create unique shapes
        and designs to suit all tastes — from rustic and elegant styles to fun and custom creations. Each scent is
        carefully chosen for its strength and beauty, designed to make every room come alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that all photos are for illustration purposes only — colours and shapes may vary slightly, as each
        product is handcrafted. However, we promise one thing: you won’t be disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of our products are <strong>vegan-friendly</strong>, and we do our best to reuse and recycle materials
        wherever possible. We’re proud to combine quality craftsmanship with an environmentally conscious approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, we host <strong>craft hours for children</strong> in the community, where they can make their own
        candles to take home — perfect for occasions like <em>Mother’s Day</em> or <em>Christmas</em>. It’s a wonderful
        way to teach creativity and create heartfelt, handmade gifts.
